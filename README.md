# Neural-Network-CSC424

Build Neural Network from scratch initially using numpy only and afterwards use pytorch and libraries.  
This course provides a strong fundanmental on what's going behind the black-box.  
The assignments are designed such a way that we understand the internal mechanism of Neural Network.  
We tweak with multiple layers, activation, loss, initializer, batching, clipping etc etc.    
Probably my favorite course from my undergrad.
